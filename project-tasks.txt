1. When I press the Done button I want the database to update the field "status" to True instead of False (Can even make a toggle)

2. Make "Del" btn work.



5. Make "Login/Sign up" button work.

6. Make "Back to the top" link work.


Ideas for future "features":
1- Filter by status (Show tasks that are not completed first) or make the completed tasks less visible (like in light gray color)

2- Add profile picture next to the logout button
